### ComCat 🤖

A Discord bot written in C# that empowers Discord communities to moderate themselves through a democratic process. The bot allows users to nominatemembers for moderation rights via a ballot system. Additionally, these users can ban other users, but doing so comes at the expense of their own moderation rights until renominated to prevent abuse. With ComCat, communities can promote transparency and fairness in their moderation practices and maintain a safe and healthy environment for all members.
